        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups julienned green papaya, soak in ice water for 10-15 minutes </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>Thai chilies, to taste </li>
            <li>1 ½ Tbsp palm sugar, finely chopped, packed</li>
            <li>2-3 long beans, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp roasted peanuts (see note)</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon small dried shrimp, roughly chop if you have large ones</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tsp tamarind paste </li>
            <li>1 ½ Tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup grape tomato halves or a small tomato cut into wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><em>Note: I prefer buying peanuts and roast them.</em></h4>

        <h2>Instruction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Drain the soaked papaya well and place in a bowl lined with 2 layers of
                paper towel to absorb excess water. You want to have as little water on 
                the papaya as possible so as to not dilute the dressing.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large mortar and pestle, pound garlic and chilies until there are 
                no more big chunks (pieces of chili skin are fine).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add palm sugar and mash with the pestle until it turns into a wet paste
                 and all the chunks are dissolved.
                </li>
            <li>
                Add long beans and pound just until they're broken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add dried shrimp and peanuts and pound to break the peanuts up slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add fish sauce, tamarind paste, and lime juice, adding the squeezed lime 
                skin into the mortar as well for extra lime fragrance. Stir with a large 
                spoon to mix and dissolve the sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add shredded papaya and tomatoes, and mix using the pound-and-flip method 
                . Once everything looks well mixed and the tomatoes 
                are just slightly crushed, it's done!
            </li>
            <li>
                Plate and sprinkle with the remaining peanuts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve with <strong> sticky rice and BBQ chichken</strong>
            </li>
        </ol>
